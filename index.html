        <h2>About.</h2>
        <br />
        <p>My name is Bailey Manzer. I am a full time student graduating with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science in the Fall of 2021. I also work full time as a manager of Costco Wholesale. I am interested in deepening my abilities and knowledge of software development by pursuing a career in the field. I have a strong desire to learn, and am self-motivated. My managerial background has provided me with excellent time-management skills, team work, problem solving skills, and leadership skills. </p>
        <br />
        <p>When I am not working, or studying I enjoy spending time with my fiance Angie and our two children Theo and Milo. Some of my personal interests include basketball (playing and watching), all types of games (video, board, card, etc.), anime, and music.</p>
